## Folder Structure

The repository is divided into several folders to make it easier to follow the learning path:

- **01-react-basics**: Introduction to React components, JSX, props, and state.
- **02-hooks**: Covers React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and custom hooks.
- **03-react-router**: Introduction to React Router for single-page applications (SPAs).
- **04-state-management**: Explanation of state management in React using Context API.
- **05-redux**: Introduction to Redux for state management, including setting up a store, actions, reducers, and middleware.
- **06-react-redux**: Integration of Redux with React using the `react-redux` library.

## Getting Started

To get started with the repository:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chuadharysagar/Learning-react.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder where you'd like to start:
    ```bash
    cd react-learning-repo/01-react-basics
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies for the selected folder:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Topics Covered

### React Basics

Located in the `01-react-basics` folder, this section covers the core concepts of React, including:
- Creating functional components.
- Using JSX to describe UI.
- Passing data with props.
- Managing local state in components.

### React Hooks

The `02-hooks` folder contains examples of using React Hooks:
- **useState** for managing state in functional components.
- **useEffect** for side effects in components.
- **useContext** for using Context API in a simpler way.

### React Router

In the `03-react-router` folder, youâ€™ll learn how to:
- Set up React Router for navigation between different pages.
- Use components like `<BrowserRouter>`, `<Route>`, and `<Link>`.

### State Management

The `04-state-management` folder provides an introduction to state management using the Context API to manage global state in a React application.

### Redux and React-Redux

The `05-redux` and `06-react-redux` folders dive into more advanced state management:
- **Redux**: Learn how to set up Redux from scratch, create actions, reducers, and the Redux store.
- **React-Redux**: Integrate Redux into React using the `react-redux` library, connecting components to the Redux store and dispatching actions.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Start with the `01-react-basics` folder and go through each example sequentially.
2. Review the code comments and documentation within each file to understand how the different concepts work.
3. Experiment by modifying the code and running the application to see the changes.
4. Progress through each folder as you build your knowledge, ending with `06-react-redux`.
